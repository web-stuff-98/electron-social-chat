Todos in order

WebRTC todos (always takes a really long fucking time. its 99% of 
the application)

 - Finish VidChatUser component. Use teleport for fullscreen.

 - Create RoomVidServer file and start working on adding room
   video chat into there

 - Settings page for media device selection

 - Instead of restarting the connection when the user mutes their
   mic, just .enable = !track.enabled

 - Clicking on VidChatUser component should open user dropdown

----------------------------------------------------------------

  Performance stuff

 - Replace regular mutexes with RWMutexes in SocketServer

 - There shouldn't be one queue for all outbound socket messages.
   There should be a mutex protecting each connection so that
   messages can be sent to different users simultaneously... or
   something similar... cannot have all messages queued in one
   loop. Its slow and beats the point of even using go in the
   first place.

----------------------------------------------------------------

 - Make composables for stuff. Vue code is too messy.
 - Attachment download button needs to actually download the attachment
 - Fix user data sometimes not being present when component visible
 - Friends & blocked list aside section
 - Socket events for creating/updating/deleting channels
 - User online indicator
 - Notifications
 - Zod & Formik
 - Go v10 validation for socket handlers
 - Clicking outside the user dropdown should close it
 - Blocking a user should kick them out of rooms
 - Blocking a user should cancel the call
 - Banning a user should kick them out of rooms
