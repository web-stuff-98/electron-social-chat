Todos in order

First:
 - Finish socket event handlers for banning/blocking users
 - Make socket event handlers for friend inviting users
 - Do client code for banning/blocking/inviting users and sending friend requests

Problematic:
 - Figure out how to get 2 instances of the dev client running... somehow, maybe using docker

Future:
 - User actions dropdown menu
 - Manual test direct messaging & invitations

and lots more
