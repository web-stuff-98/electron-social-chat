Todos in order

WebRTC todos (always takes a really long fucking time)

 - Create a hook (composable) called useMedia for video chat.
   It should return userMedia & displayMedia, and take in and
   invoke a function that should renegotioate WebRTC with the
   updated stream after adding/removing tracks. It's the only
   way to do it. It's the way WebRTC works. But you can use
   .enabled on audio tracks instead of adding/removing them

 - Video window component expand to fullscreen button 

 - Screen sharing... is it possible to send 2 streams at the same
   time? Screen sharing is an important feature. The other client
   needs some way to determine which video/audio track is for the
   screen. There is the id property attached to MediaStream. The
   client could send a message indicating that the stream with
   the matching id is the display stream

 - Add simple-peer video chat to rooms aswell
