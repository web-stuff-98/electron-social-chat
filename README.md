# UNFINISHED group video/voip chat app using Vue, Tauri & Go

## The serverside code is pretty much the same as my last project, except sessions are kept on Redis, where they should be.

It was using Electron beforehand, but I changed to tauri because its much faster and lightweight

SCSS classes are kebab cased this time, and I'm using functions instead of arrow functions for a lot of stuff
