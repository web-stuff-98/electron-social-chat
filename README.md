# Unfinished group video/voip chat app using Vue, Electron & Go

## The serverside code is pretty much the same as my last project, except sessions are kept on Redis, where they should be.

## This is my first project using Vue since probably late 2021. I learned React after Vue, then forgot how to use Vue, which is part of the reason I am making this.
