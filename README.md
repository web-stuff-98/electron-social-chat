# Unfinished group video/voip chat app using Vue, Tauri & Go

## Using Tauri & pnpm now instead of electron, because its faster. And I used Vue for this project, because I haven't used it in 16 months when I started learning webdev

## Needs to be renamed to Tauri-Go-Vue-Chat

## Vue code is very messy
